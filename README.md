# Beamformer Source Imaging
Brainstorm plug-ins for MEG and EEG source imaging, including (1) maximum contrast beamformer (MCB) for the use in localization of brain sources, (2) spatiotemporal imaging of linearly-related source components (SILSC) for the use in identification of source component linearly correlated to the activity of a seed, and (3) beamformer-based imaging of phase-amplitude coupling (BIPAC) for the use in identification of sources coupled to the specified seed. 

Beamformer-based imaging of phase-amplitude coupling (BIPAC) has been published in IEEE EMBC 2015 [1] and the paper was awarded as the open finalist of student paper competition. The program of BIPAC from has been written as a plug-in of the Matlab Software Brainstorm. Please download the program of BIPAC from Github: https://github.com/Hui-Ling/BeamformerSourceImaging. The *.m files should be placed in the the following folder: .brainstorm\process.

Please see the the tutorials of MCB, SILSC, and BIPAC in https://github.com/Hui-Ling/BeamformerSourceImaging/wiki.
