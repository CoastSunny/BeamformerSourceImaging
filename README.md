# BeamformerSourceImaging
Brainstorm plug-ins for MEG and EEG source imaging, including (1) maximum contrast beamformer (MCB) for the use in localization of brain sources and (2) beamformer-based imaging of phase-amplitude coupling (BIPAC) for the use in identification of sources coupled to seed activity.
