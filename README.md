# BeamformerSourceImaging
Brainstorm plug-ins for MEG and EEG source imaging, including (1) maximum contrast beamformer (MCB) for the use in localization of brain sources, (2) spatiotemporal imaging of linearly-related source components (SILSC) for the use in identification of source component linearly correlated to the activity of a seed, and (3) beamformer-based imaging of phase-amplitude coupling (BIPAC) for the use in identification of sources coupled to the specified seed.
